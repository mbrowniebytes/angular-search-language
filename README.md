## Find recently updated repositories in GitHub by programming language

 Made using [Angular 5](https://angular.io/), [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [GitHub Search API](https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#search-repositories).
 
 Code is based on the tutorial [Make Angular 4 app using GitHub API]( https://github.com/sandeep1995/angular-4-search-devs)
 
 Instead of searching for developers, the code now searches for recently updated repositories in GitHub.  
 Also, the code was updated to work with Angular 5 and Bootstrap 4.
